# MCP Server Repository 

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of GitHub's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, a powerful integration tool that bridges Visual Studio Code with GitHub's AI capabilities.

## About This Repository
Created on May 27, 2025, this repository serves as both a demonstration and documentation of MCP Server capabilities. It showcases how modern development workflows can leverage AI-assisted coding and repository management through VS Code.

## Key Components

### 1. Configuration
The repository uses the following MCP Server configuration in VS Code:
```json
"mcp": {
    "inputs": [
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "github_token",
            "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
            "password": true
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "github": {
            "command": "docker",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "-i",
                "--rm",
                "-e",
                "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
                "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Integration Features
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverages GitHub Copilot through MCP Server
- **Repository Management**: Direct repository operations from VS Code
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: Intelligent code suggestions and file operations
- **Secure Token Handling**: Managed through VS Code's secure storage

### 3. Development Environment
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Container Runtime**: Docker
- **Authentication**: GitHub Personal Access Token
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Shell**: Bash

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Docker Desktop
3. GitHub Account with Personal Access Token
4. VS Code GitHub Extensions

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Configure VS Code settings.json with MCP Server configuration
3. Install required VS Code extensions
4. Set up GitHub Personal Access Token
5. Start Docker Desktop

### Testing the Setup
1. Open VS Code
2. Connect to GitHub (verify token)
3. Test MCP Server connection
4. Try example operations

## Use Cases
1. **Repository Management**
   - Create and modify files
   - Manage commits and branches
   - Handle pull requests
   - Review code changes

2. **AI-Assisted Development**
   - Code completion suggestions
   - Documentation generation
   - Code refactoring assistance
   - Context-aware file operations

3. **Development Workflow Integration**
   - Seamless VS Code experience
   - Containerized execution
   - Secure credential management
   - Automated operations

## Security Considerations
- Personal Access Tokens are stored securely
- Docker container isolation
- Token scope limitations
- Secure communication protocols
