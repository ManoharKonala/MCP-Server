# GitHub MCP Server Example

This file demonstrates the functionality of the GitHub Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server.

## What is MCP Server?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is a powerful tool that enables seamless interaction between VS Code and GitHub's AI features. It acts as a bridge for:
- Managing AI model interactions
- Handling context-aware code suggestions
- Processing GitHub Copilot requests
- Managing repository operations through AI assistance

## Example Usage
This file itself was created using the MCP Server with the following configuration:
```json
{
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
    ]
}
```

## Features Demonstrated
